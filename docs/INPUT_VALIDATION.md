# Input Validation - Question Quality Control

## Problem Fixed

The system was generating answers for **random symbols** like `!@#$%^&*()` instead of rejecting them.

---

## Solution Implemented

### **1. Question Validation in qa_engine.py**

New method: `_is_valid_question()`

```python
def _is_valid_question(self, question: str) -> bool:
    """Validate if question is meaningful (not just symbols/gibberish)"""
    # Check if question is empty or too short
    if not question or len(question.strip()) < 3:
        return False
    
    # At least 50% should be alphabetic characters
    alpha_count = sum(1 for c in question if c.isalpha())
    total_chars = len(question.strip())
    
    if total_chars > 0 and alpha_count / total_chars < 0.5:
        return False
    
    # Check for at least one word
    words = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z]+', question)
    if len(words) == 0:
        return False
    
    return True
```

### **2. Validation in process_query()**

```python
# Validate question first
if not self._is_valid_question(question):
    return {
        'question': question,
        'answer': 'Please ask a meaningful question with actual words (not just symbols).',
        'relevant_chunks': [],
        'confidence': 0.0
    }
```

### **3. API Endpoint Validation in main.py**

```python
@app.post("/ask")
async def ask_question(request: QuestionRequest):
    # Validate question has actual words
    words = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z]+', request.question)
    if len(words) == 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, 
            detail="Question must contain actual words, not just symbols")
```

## Validation Rules

A question is **VALID** if:
- ✅ At least 3 characters long
- ✅ Contains at least one alphabetic word
- ✅ At least 50% alphabetic characters
- ✅ Not just symbols/numbers

A question is **INVALID** if:
- ❌ Empty or too short (< 3 chars)
- ❌ Only symbols: `!@#$%^&*()`
- ❌ Only numbers: `123456`
- ❌ Mixed symbols: `@#$!@#$`
- ❌ No actual words

---

## Examples

### Valid Questions ✅
```
"What is a matrix?"
"How do I calculate determinants?"
"Explain quantum superposition"
"What is 3+4i?"
"Define linear algebra"
```

### Invalid Questions ❌
```
"!@#$%^&*()"           - Only symbols
"123456"               - Only numbers
"@#$"                  - Just symbols
"!@#$ what"            - Mostly symbols
"a"                    - Too short
""                     - Empty
```

---

## Response Examples

### Valid Question
```
Input: "What is a matrix?"
Status: ✅ Valid
Response: [Comprehensive answer with sources]
```

### Invalid Question
```
Input: "!@#$%^&*()"
Status: ❌ Invalid
Response: "Please ask a meaningful question with actual words (not just symbols)."
```

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents Gibberish Questions** - No more random symbols
✅ **Better User Experience** - Clear error messages
✅ **Saves Resources** - Doesn't process invalid queries
✅ **Improves Quality** - Only meaningful questions answered
✅ **Dual Validation** - API level + Engine level

---

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Valid Question**
   ```
   Input: "What is Python?"
   Expected: Answer provided
   ```

2. **Symbols Only**
   ```
   Input: "!@#$%^&*()"
   Expected: Error message
   ```

3. **Numbers Only**
   ```
   Input: "123456"
   Expected: Error message
   ```

4. **Mixed**
   ```
   Input: "@#$ hello"
   Expected: Answer (contains word "hello")
   ```

5. **Empty**
   ```
   Input: ""
   Expected: Error message
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Validation Layers

**Layer 1: API Endpoint (main.py)**
- First check for actual words
- Returns 400 error if invalid
- Prevents processing invalid requests

**Layer 2: QA Engine (qa_engine.py)**
- Comprehensive validation
- Checks length, character ratio, words
- Returns user-friendly message

### Performance Impact

✅ **Minimal** - Validation is fast
✅ **Early rejection** - Stops processing immediately
✅ **Saves resources** - No unnecessary model inference

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Language detection (support multiple languages)
- [ ] Spam detection
- [ ] Question length limits
- [ ] Rate limiting per user
- [ ] Question history logging

---

## Summary

The system now:
- ✅ Rejects random symbols
- ✅ Validates question quality
- ✅ Provides clear error messages
- ✅ Only processes meaningful questions
- ✅ Saves computational resources

**Result**: Only legitimate questions are answered! 🎯
